    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am <strong>Marten Uiboupin</strong>, an 18-year-old aspiring software developer currently studying at 
      <strong> Tartu Vocational College</strong>. My journey into software development began with a strong 
      interest in game development, which fueled my passion for programming and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a solid educational foundation, having previously attended 
      <strong> Tartu Raatuse School</strong>. Beyond academics, I enjoy staying active by playing volleyball, 
      engaging in games with friends, and expressing creativity through drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my studies, I have participated in events such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VOCO Green Hackathon 2024 - Secured 5th place.</li>
      <li>VOCO "Maker of the Year 2023" - Participated in the software development category.</li>

      These experiences have enhanced my teamwork, problem-solving, and project management skills. 
      I am eager to continue developing my expertise in software development and contribute my 
      creativity and dedication to innovative projects.
